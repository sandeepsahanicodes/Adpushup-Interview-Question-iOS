# AdPushup Interview Question iOS
The interviewer requested the creation of a straightforward iOS application integrating Google's iOS Mobile Ads SDK. The app should feature a button; upon tapping it, a prompt will appear asking the user if they'd like to watch weather updates. If an ad is unavailable, another prompt will inform the user, saying "Ad is not available".
